                <p>"Reality club is not by any means original as they've shown at least on this album in particular a huge arctic monkeys influence, but in my opinion since they've successfully added their on twist on this style of indie rock and doing it justice there's nothing really to complain about how unoriginal they are, hell I might even prefer this album to some of arctic monkeys albums just because this album is that damn good."</p>

                <p>"Reality Club is a name that will always be memorable to me. They are the first band that I saw live. And I think I will never feel the same way as that day. Two speaker booming beside my ear, while the whole crowd is screaming beside my other ear. Everything is just the PERFECT amount of awfulness. In fact, I recorded ALL one hour of it :)"</p>
